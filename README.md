# Caporaso-Harris
This project implements the recursive formulas of Caporaso-Harris and Vakil to compute the number of nodal curves satisfying given tangency conditions with a divisor on the projective plane and Hirzebruch surfaces. 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
Java (7.0+) on your platform. 

### Installing

No installation is needed.

### How to use

First get into the directory for this program. Then enter

```
javac CH.java
java CH
```
in your command line. The program will show you instructions to enter inputs. The output files for numbers will be in /output/CH, and the output files for generating functions will be in /output/genFunCH. 

The CH program is for computations on the projectives planes. The F0Table and HirTable are for the product of two projecive lines and any Hirzebruch surfaces respectively. The way to run F0Table and HirTable and their ourput are same with CH except the names. 


### API Reference

The documentation is under doc directory.

### Tests

Sample output file is provided under /sample output directory. If they match with your output file it can be almost sure your program is working fine.
